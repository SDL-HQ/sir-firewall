# Patents

The SIR firewall and related work in this repository are provided under the MIT License.  
The MIT License grants rights under copyright, but does **not** grant any rights under
patents owned or controlled by SDL Limited or its contributors.

One or more patent applications owned by SDL Limited may cover methods and systems
implemented by this project (including inference-time governance, cryptographic
provenance, audit protocols and related alignment architectures).

The existence of patent filings does **not** change the terms of the MIT License for
this code, but it does mean that use of the underlying patented methods may require a
separate patent licence in some jurisdictions and use cases, especially for commercial
or large-scale deployments.

## Use, contribution and licensing

Use of this repository under the MIT License does **not** itself grant any licence to
practice any SDL patents. Whether your use requires a patent licence depends on:

- how you use this project,
- where you deploy it, and
- whether your use practices claims in any granted or pending patents.

If you are:

- a commercial vendor integrating SIR or the underlying method into a product or platform, or
- planning a large-scale deployment that relies on this architecture,

please contact SDL Limited to discuss licensing:

## Small organisations and non-profits

We do **not** want patent rights to block genuine safety work in high-stakes contexts.

If you are a small organisation, non-profit, or community provider, especially working
in mental health, health, social services or adjacent public-good domains, you are
encouraged to get in touch to discuss appropriate, low-friction licensing options.

Research, evaluation and non-commercial experimentation with this repository under the
MIT License are welcome. This file is a notice of potential patent coverage, not legal
advice. Please seek your own legal advice if you are unsure how any patents may apply
to your use.
